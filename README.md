# Goattracker2
A crossplatform music editor for creating Commodore 64 music. Uses reSID library by Dag Lem and supports alternatively HardSID & CatWeasel devices.  

This repository contains a forked copy of the sourceforge goattracker2 repo to keep track of my changes for adding USBSID-Pico support while preparing a patch for official support.

Any licensing that apply to the official Sourceforge repository apply to this fork.
